# MobStatusChange

Be in control of all mobs.

## Features

This is a plugin for minecraft bukkit/spigot/etc servers that allows you to easily edit status from all entities in the game (including mobs and players). 

It also features a new mechanic for poison, **letal poison**. You can turn this feature off, on for only players, mobs, or both at any given time by editing your configs.

Finally, it has an option to only modify player's melee damage, so you can, for example, increase player's attack speed and use a modifier lower than 1 to reduce melee damage a bit to simulate what minecraft pre-1.9 was. Or use a positive modifier to only increase player melee damage.
